## Interactive React Portfolio

I decided to challenge my skills in both programming and design in this project. The application includes my online resume designed in an interactive way as well as other pages for users to be curious and to have fun.

The application is developed to showcase techniques and technologies in front-end development. The harmony between color and code | design and programming is demonstrated. Each color stands for varied data representation techniques in a dynamic and interactive way.

## Design

Users in each page will be exposed to colors and they will interact with each component of the design. There are many mysteries to explore and to discover.

## Development

The main objective of the design was to utilise capabilities of React in order to create dynamic and functional application. 

Due to mysterious theme of the design, I ran 9 user experiences at General Assembly during the development of the project to enhance the layout and user interface.
